# shinyKnobs
A Collection of Knob Inputs for 'shiny'

## touchKnobInput and touchGripKnobInput

*These knobs are based on Chris Johnson excellent precision-inputs https://github.com/jhnsnc/precision-inputs*

These components can be styled to fit in perfectly in any app, and allow users to set precise values through many input modalities. Users can touch-and-drag, click-and-drag, scroll their mouse wheel, double click, or use keyboard input.
